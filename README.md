# 🎮 Global Game Sales Analysis

This is a data exploration project I did using Powerbi, all about Game sales across the world.
I found the dataset on Kaggle and it was fun to dig into the numbers and see which platforms, publishers, and genres are winning the gaming race. 🚀

# 📁 Dataset
- File: `video_game_sales.csv`
- Data Source: [Kaggle - Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)

Some data was messy or had missing values, but I just cleaned it up where needed.
This wasn’t a deep analysis, It was more of a hands on visual exploration and Power BI practice.
